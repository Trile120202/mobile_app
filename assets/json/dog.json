Formulated with feather protein hydrolysate, Royal Canin Anallergenic contains very low molecular weight oligopeptides and free amino acids. Larger proteins of a certain size are more likely to cause an allergic reaction. Low weight oligopeptides and free amino acids are proteins which have been broken into very small pieces to reduce the risk of them being able to cause a reaction in even the very sensitive of dogs and cats.
